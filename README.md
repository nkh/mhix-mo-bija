# mhix-moħbija

Some idea about a ticketing system which doesn't hide the tickets

## What with the name?

*mhix-moħbija* is Maltese for "not hidden", Maltese is a mind blowing language, it's half "Derja" the language of north Africa and half Italian.

## What's different?

Tickets are considered first class objects, *versionned*, and in plain sight.
